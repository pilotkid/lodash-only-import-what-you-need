# Lodash Import Only What You Need!

This is a quick extension that allows you to replace your lodash imports quickly and easily using indvidual module importing. This is ideal for existing projects that use lodash frequently but need to reduce bundle size.

For example this plugin will change the following code

```js
import _ from 'lodash';
lodash.filter(array1, (x) => x.isEnabled);
lodash.orderBy(array1, (x) => x.Name);
```

To

```js
import filter from 'lodash/filter';
import orderBy from 'lodash/orderBy';
filter(array1, (x) => x.isEnabled);
orderBy(array1, (x) => x.Name);
```

## Features

- Reduce bundle size with a single action
  - Just use the command pallet and select `Lodash Shake`

- Run when you need to.
  - You can develop importing the full lodash library and use this plugin to clean up your code after

  - It doesn't matter what you importted lodash as it will work
